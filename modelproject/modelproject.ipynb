    "# OLG Economy (Diamond Model)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Overlapping Generations (OLG) Diamond model, developed by Peter Diamond in the 1960s, is a widely used framework in economics to examine intergenerational dynamics and various economic phenomena. This model offers valuable insights into the interactions between different generations, capital accumulation, and economic growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "One key feature of the OLG Diamond model is its intergenerational aspect. The model assumes that individuals are born into the young generation and progress through the life cycle. When individuals reach the old stage, they retire and transfer their accumulated wealth to the next generation. This intergenerational transfer mechanism is a fundamental aspect of the model and plays a crucial role in determining economic outcomes and welfare.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will investigate how households optimize their consumption, saving, and labor supply decisions over their lifetimes. By examining the equilibrium conditions of the model, we aim to understand the factors that drive consumption, savings, and welfare outcomes in an OLG Diamond framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The utility is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ U = \\ln(c_{1t}) + \\beta \\ln(c_{2t+1}), \\beta \\in [0,1]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The single period dynamic budget constraints are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ c_{1t} = w_t - s_t $$\n",
    "$$ c_{2t+1} = (1+r_{t+1}) s_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The intertemporal Budget Constraint (IBC) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ c_{1t} + \\frac{c_{2t+1}}{1+r_{t+1}} = w_t $$\n",
