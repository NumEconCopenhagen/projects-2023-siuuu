    "The Diamond Overlapping Generations Model (Diamond-OLG) is a particular class of models employed to examine the dynamics of an economy, especially in relation to economic growth and intergenerational effects. Diamond-OLG models are characterized by distinct time periods in which at least two separate generations coexist. In the version we explore here, each period is comprised of two generations: a young working generation and an older retired generation. Individuals in the model live for two periods, overlapping with the life cycles of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "During their two-period lives, individuals consume in both periods, but only save in their first period, as they exhaust all their resources before passing away at the end of the second period. Consequently, they earn labor income in their first period and capital income in their second period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Beginning of period t:** generation t is born\n",
    "**Period t:** generation t is employed\n",
    "**End of period t:** generation t consumes and saves\n",
    "**Period t+1:** generation t invests\n",
    "**End of period t+1:** generation t consumes and passes away\n",
    "First, we will derive the general framework of the Diamond-OLG model, and then we will expand the model by incorporating government intervention, including taxation and debt issuance. By doing so, we demonstrate that the Diamond-OLG model is versatile and capable of addressing more complex issues in economic analysis.\n",
