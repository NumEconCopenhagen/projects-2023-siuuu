# Model analysis project

In the IS-LM model, we begin with the goods market. As per basic economics, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at any given time (t) is the sum of household consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. For this model, we assume a closed economy, meaning there is no international trade, and the country operates in an independent economy.


The results of the project can be seen from running IS-LMModelproject.ipynb.


Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
