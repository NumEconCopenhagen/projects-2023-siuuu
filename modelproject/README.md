# Model analysis project

Our project is titled OLG Economy (Diamond Model) and is about the Diamond OLG model. This model offers valuable insights into the interactions between different generations, capital accumulation, and economic growth.

The results of the project can be seen from running modelproject.ipynb.


Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
